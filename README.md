# ðŸ”— DoR - DNS over RNG

I had the stupid idea of a DNS server that just spits out random IP addresses, thus sending you to random websites on every request.

So I made it. It's bad.

I threw this together in an afternoon. It's extremely unoptimized, slow, and barely tested. This project is NOT in a state where it can practically function as a real DNS server.

Obviously DO NOT use this as your real DNS server, unless you just love inflicting chaos upon yourself I guess...

I plan on rewriting this to be more practical and usable (but still horrendously bad and evil) eventually...
